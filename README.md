This repository holds all the partcipation worksheets for STAT547. Each class meeting has a knit `HTML` file of the participation worksheet, and some class meetings have attached, external files and links that are part of the submission. All important files for completion of the participatory activities can be found in the table below:

## Instructions

1. Before class starts, find the Rmd (and any required data files) from [the class Discussions repo](https://github.com/STAT547-UBC-2019-20/Discussions/tree/master/participation)

2. Download and then move the files into your participation repo locally on your computer.

3. Commit and push the files to your participation repo.

4. Work on the files during and if needed, after class. Remember to commit and push frequently.

5. When you're ready to submit the participation repo at the end of the course, create a release and submit the link on Canvas

6. Remember to knit your Rmd files to a human-readable format (html, PDF, md, etc...)!

## Grading

The participation repo will be graded as described [here](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/evaluation/participation/). (Also see below!)   

## Criteria

**Due:** Saturday, April 10, at 18:00

The intent of the participation assessment is to encourage following along with class activities, which are usually coding sessions. You’ll be putting all your in-class work in your own participation repository hosted on your GitHub user account, which we will evaluate at the end of the course.

### Expectations

In short, we’re evaluating _completeness_, not _correctness_. Specifically:

Your participation component will be evaluated by the completeness of your repository. You’ll be prompted in class when you should be contributing to your participation repository.

#### Completeness (70%)

Your repository should be _complete_ with all in-class exercises. Your work should resemble an honest _attempt_ at the activities, but __does not__ need to be anywhere near “correct” – even completely failing at an activity will earn you full marks here!

Of 12 classes, we will mark your 10 best so each class is worth 1% of your STAT 547 course grade.

#### Documentation (30%)

Your repository should be _well-documented_.

- [x] 10%: Does your main README orient a stranger to your repository?
- [x] 10%: Will a stranger be able to figure out what the main files of your repository are for, and where they are located?
- [x] 10%: Are the contents of your files human readable? Although we aren’t expecting publication-quality prose, there should be a moderate level of readability of your scripts to earn you full points here.
